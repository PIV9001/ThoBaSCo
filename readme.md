# ThoBaSCo, a Semianalytical Thomson Backscattering Code

(Tho)mson (Ba)ck(S)cattering (Co)de is a python based code to calculate spectral or spatial radiation
intensity distributions for Thomson backscattering events. Single electrons or whole bunches can be simulated.

The following .py files only contain function definitions: 
ThoBaSCo_kernel.py
arb_angle_lin_amp.py
arb_angle_circ_amp.py

The other files are the scripts to simulate the various Thomson backscattering scenarios.

More details coming soon.
